# Reel Jobs

Reel Jobs is a Ruby on Rails web application created by Adnan Ahmed, Tobias Brändli, Tim De Groot, Charlie Merrill, and Gonçalo Novo. The program was built over the course of a week as a project for Le Wagon coding school. The purpose of Reel Jobs is to help people find work experience in the film industry and to help filmmakers find people to work on their productions. Our target audience is low-budget and student films.
