## Searching For Projects

Users can search for projects by filming location, date, and skill. Our search results will provide a list of projects meeting their criteria.

## Applying For Jobs

Each project page displays a list of jobs available on that project. Users can submit an application and see how many others have applied for the same job.

## User Profile

Each user is given a user profile page. The page provides information about the user, a list of the user's projects, and reviews of the user's performance on each project.

## Creating A Project

A user can create their own project if they want to hire other users. A user's project will appear in search results after they have entered details about the project and added jobs.

## Accepting Applications

Job applications are displayed to the project owner on the project page. The owner can view the applicants' profiles and decide who to accept.

## Reviews

Project owners can review the performance of those who worked on their project. These reviews will be displayed in the user's profile.
